This API allows users to retrieve information about scientists by making HTTP requests to the API's endpoints. The API has two endpoints: /random and /api/<shortname>. The /random endpoint returns a random scientist, while the /api/<shortname> endpoint returns information about the specified scientist. Both endpoints return the data in JSON format.

- To use the API, users can send an HTTP GET request to the appropriate endpoint with the desired parameters. For example, to get a random scientist, the user would send a GET request to the /random endpoint. To get information about a specific scientist, the user would send a GET request to the /api/shortname endpoint, replacing shortname with the name of the scientist you are interested in.

- The API is built using Node.js and the Express.js library.
